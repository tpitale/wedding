<h3>What’s a wedding tour?</h3>
<p>Well, we made it up. We didn’t want to pick between our homes, so we decided to celebrate at each one. Think of it like a book or music tour: We want to make it easy for you to celebrate with us, so we’re bringing the party to you!</p>

<h3>What will the parties be like?</h3>
<p>Each party will include the key elements of a wedding: ceremony, food, and music! Veronica and Tony and both pairs of their parents will be at all three parties.</p>

<h3>Which party should I attend?</h3>
<p>We expect you to go to the party that corresponds to how we know you. Know Veronica, Millie, and Ron best? St. Louis in May is for you. Know Anthony, Tony, and Anne best? New Jersey in August is calling your name. Lived in DC while Veronica and Tony did? The capital in October waits for you. If you knew us in school, well, come to the party that most suits you!</p>

<h3>Could I attend more than one party?</h3>
<p>Wow! We love you, too! Yes, we’re planning on a handful of people besides our parents attending more than one party. Just give us a heads up when you RSVP.</p>

<h3>Can’t make any of these dates or places?</h3>
<p>Let’s celebrate another way! Just like book and music tours, we welcome the addition of “private events” to our wedding tour.</p>

<h3>I have more questions!</h3>
<p>Send us a note, and we’ll get you some answers.</p>
