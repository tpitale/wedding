title: Our Story | Veronica &amp; Tony's Marriage
---

<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>Five years ago, we spotted each other across of handshake greetings. Today, we enter the future together.</p>

<h2>Our Wedding Tour</h2>
<p>Veronica grew up outside of St. Louis; Tony grew up in New Jersey. The two of us met in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>A few years later, Tony proposed to Veronica at a waterfall that he visited when he was a kid. A couple years after that, the two of us moved to St. Louis.</p>
<p>Over the years, we've each come to see our partner's family home as our own. We're so excited to get to celebrate in all three places closest to our hearts!</p>
